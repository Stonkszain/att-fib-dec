# Atrial Fibrillation Treatment Tool

This is a project to help clinicians and patients collaboratively decide which treatment path they should pick given their preferences

*Disclaimer the current preference criteria and treatment selection are not real and should not be used in a clinical setting. This project is solely to prototype the concept*
